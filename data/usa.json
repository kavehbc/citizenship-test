    "note": "&#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner&#8221; is the name of our national anthem. The song is about the United States flag. In the War of 1812, the United States fought the British. One night during the war, British ships attacked Fort McHenry in Baltimore. Bombs exploded all night. An American man named Francis Scott Key watched the battle from a ship. He worried that the United States might lose the battle. The next morning, he saw the United States&#8217; flag flying in the wind. He knew that the United States won the battle. Then he wrote the words to &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner.&#8221; &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner&#8221; is now the national anthem of the United States."
